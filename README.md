# Machine_Learning_Programming  

Course MICRO-401 (EPFL): This course gives an overview of methods of Machine Learning for the analysis of non-linear, highly noisy, and multi-dimensional data. We will see methods to pre-process the data in order to find features. We will see methods for clustering, classification, and nonlinear regression.
